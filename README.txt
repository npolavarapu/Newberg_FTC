This code is meant to provide a simple and clean teleop and autonomous for 
FTC robots using robotC. The main teleop file is "teleTK' and the main autonomous
is "autoTK." This code was organized and written by Tyler K of Team 4586 in Newberg,
Oregon. Feel free to use it to better program, automate, and organize your robot's
code. Acknowledgement is appreciated.
